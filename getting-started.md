Once on the Juptyerhub, you will be in the `/notebooks` directory, which contains the content to be used for the short course.

## Investigate Tutorial Materials and Follow Prerequisites

The tutorial materials are available online (https://openradarscience.org/ams-open-radar-2023), and we encourage participants to investigate the materials before attending the workshop. For example, in one of the first examples (the radar example), we encourage participants to investigate the prerequisites, and ensure they are familiar with the material. While this is not required for participants, it is highly encouraged.
